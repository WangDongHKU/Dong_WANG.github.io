**Infectious Disease Modelling | Epidemiology | Complex Networks | Bayesian inference| Phylodynamics**
## About
---
I am a  Postdoctoral Fellow at HKU School of Public Health with a PhD in **Mathematics**. I focus on **infectious disease modelling** and **Bayesian inference**, integrating **epidemiological**, **genomic**, **human mobility**, and **environmental data** within mechanistic frameworks. Passionate about leveraging large-scale **viral genomics and network analysis** to uncover transmission dynamics and inform the development of more effective spatial/global disease control strategies.

## Selected Projects
---
- The impact of higher-order interactions in human mobility networks on COVID-19 transmission in Hong Kong and mainland China     
   Role: Principal Investigator | Funding: Health and Medical Research Fund    
Developed  higher-order mechanistic network models integrating human mobility, **genetic** and NPI data; and applied likelihood‑based fitting to partially observed epidemic data for risk assessment.    

- Identifying the dynamical interaction among respiratory viruses, including influenza and COVID-19, and prediction of their cocirculation burden in the post-pandemic period using multi-stream data     
   Role: Co-Investigator | Funding: General Research Fund    
Built mechanistic models with multi-stream surveillance to predict influenza and COVID-19 activity and estimate their interactions.
