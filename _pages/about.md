**Research Highlights:**
- **Eco‑epidemiology:** Predictive models for **vector‑borne disease risk**, **weather‑dependent human behavior**, and environmental drivers of transmission.
- **Phylogeographic modeling:** Pathogen dispersal using genomic data (e.g., **GISAID**) and global mobility networks (**OAG**).
- **Mechanistic epidemic modelling & data fitting:** Bayesian hierarchical and likelihood‑based calibration of compartmental and network models to **partially observed data**.
- **Decision support:** Nowcasting, forecasting, and intervention evaluation for infectious disease control.
