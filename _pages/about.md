**Infectious Disease Modelling | Epidemiology | Complex Networks | Bayesian inference**
## About
---
I am a  Postdoctoral Fellow at HKU School of Public Health with a PhD in **Mathematics**. I focus on **infectious disease modelling** and **Bayesian inference**, integrating **epidemiological**, **genomic**, **human mobility**, and **environmental data** within mechanistic frameworks. Passionate about leveraging large-scale **viral genomics and network analysis** to uncover transmission dynamics and inform the development of more effective spatial/global disease control strategies.

## Selected Projects
---
- The impact of higher-order interactions in human mobility networks on COVID-19 transmission in Hong Kong and mainland China ␣␣␣␣
   Role: Principal Investigator | Funding: Health and Medical Research Fund | Year: 2023– 
Developed  higher-order mechanistic network models integrating human mobility, **genetic** and NPI data; and applied likelihood‑based fitting to partially observed epidemic data for risk assessment.␣␣␣␣

- **Identifying the dynamical interaction among respiratory viruses, including influenza and COVID-19, and prediction of their cocirculation burden in the post-pandemic period using multi-stream data** ␣␣␣␣ 
   Role: Co-Investigator | Funding: General Research Fund | Year: 2025–␣␣␣␣
Built mechanistic models with multi-stream surveillance to predict influenza and COVID-19 activity and estimate their interactions.

## Skills
---
-  Core: epidemiology, higher-order interaction modelling, statistical inference, complex network analysis, spatial analytics, Bayesian hierarchical modelling, genomic epidemiology, collective behaviour analysis.
-  Focus: synthesising epidemiological, geographic, phylogenetic, and network approaches to quantify how viral evolution and human mobility shape transmission patterns.
-  Tooling: R (ggplot2, **RStan**; modelling and inference), Python (pandas; data manipulation and analysis), MATLAB (numerical computation and algorithm development).
