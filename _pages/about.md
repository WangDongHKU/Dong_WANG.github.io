## About
I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at the **School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong**, specialising in **mathematical and statistical modelling of infectious diseases**. My research integrates **epidemiological, genomic, mobility, and environmental data** with **Bayesian inference** and **mechanistic frameworks** to understand transmission dynamics and inform public health strategies.

## Professional Statement
Quantitative high-order modelling of infectious disease transmission, with particular emphasis on the integration of multiple data streams, including epidemiological, human mobility,
non-pharmaceutical intervention, genomic datasets, climates, etc, to improve our understanding and prediction of infectious disease dynamics, and to inform the development of more effective spatial/global disease control strategies.

## Selected Projects
- **Higher‑order mobility networks & COVID‑19 transmission**  
PI | Health and Medical Research Fund (HK$551,440)  
Developed mechanistic network models integrating Baidu Migration; applied likelihood‑based fitting to partially observed epidemic data for risk assessment.

- **Co‑circulation of respiratory viruses (Influenza & COVID‑19)**  
Co‑I | General Research Fund (HK$1,015,417)  
Built Bayesian hierarchical models using multi‑stream surveillance to forecast influenza activity and hospital burden.

## Skills
-  Epidemiology; Mathematical high-order modelling; Statistical inference; complex network analysis; geographic and spatial analytics; Bayesian hierarchical modelling; genomic
epidemiology; analysis of collective behaviour. 
Particularly adept at higher-order infectious disease modelling that synthesises epidemiological, geographic, phylogenetic, and network approaches to elucidate the impact of viral evolution and human mobility on shaping patterns of disease transmission.
- Extensive experience with **R**, including data visualisation (ggplot2), bioinformatics workflows, and, in particular, mathematical modelling and statistical inference via **RStan**. Proficient in Python for data manipulation and analysis (pandas, among others), as well as **MATLAB** for numerical computations and algorithmic development.
