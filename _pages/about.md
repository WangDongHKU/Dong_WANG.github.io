**Infectious Disease Modelling | Epidemiology | Complex Networks | Bayesian inference | Phylodynamics**
## About
---
I am a  Postdoctoral Fellow at HKU School of Public Health with a PhD in **Mathematics**. I focus on **infectious disease modelling** and **Bayesian inference**, integrating **epidemiological**, **genomic**, **human mobility**, and **environmental data** within mechanistic frameworks. Passionate about leveraging large-scale **viral genomics and network analysis** to uncover transmission dynamics and inform the development of more effective spatial/global disease control strategies.

## Selected Projects
---
- <span style="color: purple; font-weight:bold;">The impact of higher-order interactions in human mobility networks on COVID-19 transmission in Hong Kong and mainland China</span>    
  **Role: Principal Investigator** | Funding: Health and Medical Research Fund    
Developed  **higher-order mechanistic network models** integrating **human mobility**, **genetic**, **NPI data**, etc.; and applied **likelihood‑based fitting** to partially observed epidemic data for risk assessment.    

- **Identifying the dynamical interaction among respiratory viruses, including influenza and COVID-19, and prediction of their cocirculation burden in the post-pandemic period using multi-stream data**     
   **Role: Co-Investigator** | Funding: General Research Fund    
Built mechanistic models with multi-stream surveillance to predict influenza and COVID-19 activity and estimate their interactions.
