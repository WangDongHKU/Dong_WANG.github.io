## About
---
I am a  Postdoctoral Fellow at HKU School of Public Health with a PhD in **Mathematics**. I focus on **infectious disease modelling** and **Bayesian inference**, integrating **epidemiological**, **genomic**, **human mobility**, and **environmental data** within mechanistic frameworks. Passionate about leveraging large-scale **viral genomics and network analysis** to uncover transmission dynamics and inform the development of more effective spatial/global disease control strategies.

## Selected Projects
- **The impact of higher-order interactions in human mobility networks on the transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong and mainland China**  
**PI** | Health and Medical Research Fund (HK$551,440)  
Developed  higher-order mechanistic network models integrating human mobility, **genetic** and NPI data; and applied likelihood‑based fitting to partially observed epidemic data for risk assessment.

- **Identifying the dynamical interaction among respiratory viruses, including influenza and COVID-19, and prediction of their cocirculation burden in the post-pandemic period using multi-stream data**  
**Co‑I** | General Research Fund (HK$1,015,417)  
Built mechanistic models using multi‑stream surveillance to predict influenza and COVID-19 activity and estimate their interaction.

## Skills
-  Epidemiology; Mathematical high-order modelling; Statistical inference; complex network analysis; geographic and spatial analytics; Bayesian hierarchical modelling; genomic epidemiology; analysis of collective behaviour. 
Particularly adept at higher-order infectious disease modelling that synthesises epidemiological, geographic, phylogenetic, and network approaches to elucidate the impact of viral evolution and human mobility on shaping patterns of disease transmission.
- Extensive experience with **R**, including data visualisation (ggplot2), bioinformatics workflows, and, in particular, mathematical modelling and statistical inference via **RStan**. Proficient in Python for data manipulation and analysis (pandas, among others), as well as **MATLAB** for numerical computations and algorithmic development.
